_Description: Should post-installation script index your man pages?
 Swish++ will be run once a week to index your man pages.

 The index can also be generated (in the background) by the post-installation script.
 This process needs quite a lot of computer resources, and can take several minutes
 so you can choose now if you would like to do this.

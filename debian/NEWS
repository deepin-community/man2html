man2html (1.6g-13) unstable; urgency=medium

  hman(1) utility script will now execute sensible-browser by default
  instead of  using lynx with its lynxcgi support, that is usually
  disabled for security reasons.

  The usage of lynxcgi by hman can be forced by using -P lynxcgi
  option or by setting MANHTMLPAGER=lynxcgi in the environment.

man2html (1.6g-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  The man2html package now installs Apache2 configuration file that
  restricts access to the man2html CGI program to localhost only.
  If it is not a desired behavior, please update settings in the
  /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/man2html.conf file and then reload apache2.

man2html (1.6g-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The man2html binary package has been recently split into two following parts:

    1. man2html-base    which provides the command-line man to HTML converter
                        and does not depend on any web server stuff;

    2. man2html         which includes the CGI program and obviously requires
                        both the man2html-base and web server (or lynx) to be
                        installed.

  In case you don't need to access your man pages with CGI interface, you can
  safely remove the man2html package, leaving the base part installed only.
